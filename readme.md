# Flat List Test

```
npm install
npm start
```

Open project in xcode and run in simulator / in a new terminal run `react-native run-ios`

Open a browser window to `http://localhost:7007`

Should be able to recreate / experience this odd behavior (notice the item doesn't render until we start scrolling):
